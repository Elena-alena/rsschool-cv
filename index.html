        <p><center>After graduating from the institute, I have been working for an energy company for 15 years. I worked in various engineering positions. For the last three years, I have been the head of the production and technical department. Now I realized that in my profession I do not get any new skills. So, I decided to study programming. Maybe this will change my life. In addition, I think it will help me better understand the structure, philosophy, and laws of the universe, its laws are too much like a kind of code.</p>
